# Hotpass
This program will help you in creating a dictionary that (I hope) will be used
for educational purposes and will help you in creating your own project.

The author of this project is Fenix, which expects you the most activity and 
error notifications.You can contact the author as follows: write by mail 
fenix.github.errors@gmail.com or join our group in a telegram:

This program is a demo version of a real giant that will help you as well 
(or maybe better) like crunch and other tools.
Within a few weeks, the program will begin to work stably, and, possibly,
its size will decrease.

If errors occur, the author insists on writing to her and clearly explaining
where the error occurred. For projects or assistance to the author, please 
write to andyournameshallbeofserpent@gmail.com
